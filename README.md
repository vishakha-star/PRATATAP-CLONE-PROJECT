# PRATATAP-CLONE-PROJECT
This is an educational project that aims to build a clone of Pratatap project: an entertainment/game that play different animations and sound effects when you hit different keyboard keys.
I build this website as part of "The Web Developer Bootcamp - Colt Steele" Udemy Course using Paper.js (for the graphics) and Howler.js (for the sounds).
